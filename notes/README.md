# Notes

Here are collected a bunch of notes, to clarify investigation of trivial and
non-trivial aspects.

Non-trivial results are collected to be reused. Trivial ones to develop
confidence (and not to worry again about)

## Table of contents

- [posterior non-gaussianity](./posterior-gaussianity.md)

extra:

- notes on [variational Bayes](./varbayes/README.md)
  - I don't consider a promising approach, but better to keep in mind _AC_
