# MCPDF

Sample the PDF posterior distribution.

- [notes](./notes/README.md) contains any kind of annotation, including
  considerations and intermediate results
- [project](./project/README.md) contains the roadmap
- [experiments](./experiments) are just small, self-contained experiments,
  mainly to check properties or to play with tools (including any half-baked
  solution)
- [src](./src/README.md) contains the source for all the various intermediate
  attempts, but full attempts (possibly on simplified problems)

## Name

The name `mcpdf` is just the temporary identifier for the project, chosen to be
"compatible" with `nnpdf` (since the deliverable will be once more an MC set,
but also because at some point MCMC will be involved).

In some sense, it comes just from a generalization, since no neural network is
going to be involved.
