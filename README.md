# MCPDF

Sample the PDF posterior distribution.

- [notes](./notes/README.md) contains any kind of annotation, including
  considerations and intermediate results
- [project](./project/README.md) contains the roadmap
- [experiments](./experiments) are just small, self-contained experiments,
  mainly to check properties or to play with tools (including any half-baked
  solution)
- [src](./src/README.md) contains the source for all the various intermediate
  attempts, but full attempts (possibly on simplified problems)
